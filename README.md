# AccountCreation Smart Contract

## Overview

`AccountCreation` is a smart contract designed for creating user accounts with age verification. The contract ensures that users are above a certain age before they can create an account and allows unique usernames to prevent duplicates.

## Features

- **Age Verification**: Ensures users are above 18 years old before they can create an account.
- **Unique Usernames**: Prevents duplicate usernames using a mapping to track existing names.
- **User Management**: Allows users to check their age verification status and retrieve their account details.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

First, install the required dependencies (if any).

```bash
npm install
```

### Deploying the Contract

1. Open the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file named `AccountCreation.sol` and paste the contract code into it.
3. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
4. Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network. Ensure that you have enough ETH to cover the gas fees for deployment.

### Contract Details

- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.25

## Contract Functions

### Structs

#### User

```solidity
struct User {
    uint age;
    string name;
    bool isAgeVerified;
}
```

### Mappings

#### users

Mapping to store user details by their Ethereum address.

```solidity
mapping(address => User) private users;
```

#### nameExists

Mapping to track the existence of usernames to prevent duplicates.

```solidity
mapping(string => bool) private nameExists;
```

### checkAge

Verifies that the user is above 18 years old. Uses `require` to enforce this condition.

```solidity
function checkAge(uint _age) public {
    require(_age > 18, "You must be older than 18 to create an account");
    users[msg.sender].age = _age;
    users[msg.sender].isAgeVerified = true;
}
```

### createAccount

Creates an account for the user if they have verified their age and the username is unique. Uses `revert` to enforce these conditions.

```solidity
function createAccount(string memory _name) public {
    if (users[msg.sender].isAgeVerified == false) {
        revert("You are not legal to create an account");
    }
    require(nameExists[_name] == false, "Name is already taken");
    users[msg.sender].name = _name;
    nameExists[_name] = true;
}
```

### verifyAgeCheck

Returns the age verification status of the user.

```solidity
function verifyAgeCheck() public view returns (string memory) {
    if(users[msg.sender].isAgeVerified == true){
        return("Legal");
    } else{
        return("Not Legal");
    }
}
```

### getUser

Returns the details of the user: age, name, and age verification status.

```solidity
function getUser() public view returns (uint, string memory, bool) {
    User memory user = users[msg.sender];
    return (user.age, user.name, user.isAgeVerified);
}
```

## Usage

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Check Age**:
   - Call the `checkAge` function with your age as the parameter. This will verify if you are above 18 and set your age verification status.

    ```solidity
    checkAge(20)
    ```

2. **Create Account**:
   - Call the `createAccount` function with your desired username as the parameter. Ensure your age is verified and the username is unique.

    ```solidity
    createAccount("username123")
    ```

3. **Verify Age Check**:
   - Call the `verifyAgeCheck` function to check if your age has been verified.

    ```solidity
    verifyAgeCheck()
    ```

4. **Get User Details**:
   - Call the `getUser` function to retrieve your account details, including age, username, and age verification status.

    ```solidity
    getUser()
    ```

## Security Considerations

- Ensure the age verification process is secure and accurate.
- Regularly review and audit the contract for potential vulnerabilities.
- Protect your private key to prevent unauthorized access to your account.
